tool for MS-DOS that can be used to create simple or elaborate drawings. 
 Combine contains all the tools needed for creating and editing images. 

The Combine editing screen is shown below.</p>

<P>Unlike MS Paint and most other simple drawing programs Combine allows 
the user to define and edit graphic objects which are composed of graphic 
primitives like lines, circles, curves etc. This is a distinguishing 
feature of Combine with which a user can produce precise and neat drawings 
with ease.  A user can define a graphic object say the graphic model of a 
house, a car or any other complex figure and apply the basic transformation 
operations like translation scaling, and rotation. Since these operations 
manipulate the coordinates of the graphic primitives and not the image, 
the result of these operations does not result in loss of clarity in the 
image. Another special feature of Combine is the fully editable cubic 
Bezier curves. The Bezier curve tool can be used to specify control 
points to draw cubic Bezier curve and to edit the control points by 
positioning them with the mouse to change the shape of the Bezier curve.
