<font size="4" color="#FFFFCC"><br><p>Locksj is a simple encryption program with which you can
encrypt files and folders on hard drives or floppy drives.  The current version uses a fairly
vigorous encryption method which is reliable enough. Don't forget to check for upgrades, 
that may include more vigorous encryption techniques.  Before you start using Locksj 
you must know a bit atleast, about how to use this little monster and the monsterous trouble 
it can put you and your computer into, when it is used improperly or thoughtlessly.  
<br><br><b><font size="5" color="#0099FF">The Locksj Key</font></b><br>Locksj scrambles files using a key(password) given by the user.  
Locksj intends to encrypt files in such a way that no software including, Locksj 
itself, can decrypt the encrypted files without the right key. This means if
you forget the key Locksj is not going to do you any help.  The key, in addition to
to being the key for locking/unlocking files, also conveys certain information to Locksj
about whether to scramble hiden files also, and whether to scramble the entire file
or only a part of it.  You must therefore frame keys(passwords) keeping mind the following
rules.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first character of the key must be a letter of the alphabet (a..z).
	This letter determines the number of bytes from the begining of the file that
	will be scrambled (length of scrambling).  If the first letter of the key is 'a' then the first
	16 bytes of each of the files will be scrambled, if it is 'b' instead then the 
	number of bytes that will be scrambled will be twice of that of 'a' that is
	32 bytes, and twice of this when 'c' is the first character in the key and
	so on.  <br><br>
	<li>This should be followed by a number not exceeding ten digits in length.<br><br>
	<li>If the first digit of the number i.e., the second character of the key
	is 0 (zero) then even hiden files will be encypted.<br><br>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above Locksj can scramble a part of the file with the size of this 
part being a power of 2 with 16 bytes (for 'a') being the minimum size and 1 gigabyte
(for 'z') being the maximum size.  However files involved in the scrambling process
can be of any size; there is no restriction on the size of the files being scrambled.
</p><b><font size="5" color="#0099FF">System Requirements</font></b><br>
<p>When using Locksj you must make sure there is enough space on the disk
for the temporay files that Locksj may create. The minimum space required depends
on the length of scramble (specified by the first character of the key),
the size of the largest file being scrambled and the total number of files being
scrambled.<br>
The memory requirement depends on the total number of files being scrambled.
However when Locksj is run in DOS shell of Windows&copy; (as you would be doing probably)practically there
would be no problem in the functioning of Locksj even for very large number of files.<br>
<br><font size="5" color="#0099FF"><b>Possible dangers of using Locksj</b></font><br>
The current version of locksj does not include the auto-restore feature and so
files that become corrupt in any event of failures may be lost forever.  It recommended that 
you don't encrypt very important files for which you don't have backups. Failures may occur 
when access to a file that is to be encrypted is denied. Make sure there are no such files
among the files that you want to encrypt. If there are such files you can make Locksj
skip such files by making them hiden. In this situation you must not be encrypting hiden files.
<br><br><font size="5" color="#0099FF"><b><i>Modus operandi</i> of usage</b></font>
<ul>
	<li>Double click on the locksj.exe file icon.
	<li>Specify the complete(absolute) path of the folder where you would like
	locksj to create temporary files. Path should always end in '\', for example c:\anand_temp\ is a valid path.
    <li>Specify the complete(absolute) path of the folder which you want to lock/unlock.
    <li>Enter a key satisfying the key framing rules. for example m123 
    is a valid key which indicates that the scramble-length is 4 Kbytes ( m = 2^12)
    and hiden files should not be scrambled (the second character of the key
    is ( ='1') not '0').
    <li>Standby and respond to the messages that Locksj might throw on the screen.
    <li>A list of files processed is displayed as each file is processed.
</ul></p></font>
